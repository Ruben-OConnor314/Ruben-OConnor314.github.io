## Overview

An interior visualisation study based on Wavelet House, designed by Fougeron Architecture. The project completed as one of three mini projects I did as part of my final year at university. I focused on capturing the open, light-filled atmosphere of the space, with an emphasis on modern material detail, glazing, and strong natural lighting.

The scene was created in 3DS Max and rendered using VRay, with post-processing supported by a subtle LUT to refine the overall colour profile and mood.
