## Overview

A freelance interior visualisation project created to help the client preview how their home would look after converting it into an open-plan living and kitchen space by removing some internal walls. The goal was to produce clean, realistic renders with a bright, modern aesthetic suitable for design planning and presentation.

I built and assembled the scene, created realistic materials, and developed natural daylight lighting to capture soft shadows, window highlights, and subtle bounce light. The final beauty renders were produced as polished visuals for client review and decision-making.
